# Pneumonia Detection Models

## Overview
This repository contains Python notebooks for implementing and evaluating deep learning models for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The models included are **ResNet50** and **VGG16**, both of which are popular convolutional neural network architectures known for their performance in image classification tasks.

## Contents
- **ResNet50 Notebook**: 
  - This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the ResNet50 architecture for pneumonia detection, focusing on feature extraction and classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations of performance.

- **VGG16 Notebook**: 
  - This notebook showcases the application of the VGG16 architecture for the same task. Similar to the ResNet50 notebook, it includes steps for data preparation, model fitting, evaluation, and comprehensive performance analysis.

## Key Features
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Each notebook evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices to provide insights into how effectively each model diagnoses pneumonia.
- **Visualizations**: Plots of training history (loss and accuracy) and confusion matrices are included to offer a clear picture of the models' performances.
- **Implications for Healthcare**: The findings contribute to the growing field of AI in medical diagnostics, emphasizing the importance of accurate and timely pneumonia detection.

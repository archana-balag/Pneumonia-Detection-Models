# Pneumonia-Detection-Models
This repository contains Python notebooks for implementing and evaluating deep learning models for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The models included are ResNet50 and VGG16, both of which are popular convolutional neural network architectures known for their performance in image classification tasks.
